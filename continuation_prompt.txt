DEEP16 PROJECT CONTINUATION - MILESTONE 3pre1

CONTEXT:
- Architecture: Deep16 v3.2 (16-bit RISC, segmented memory, shadow registers)
- Current: Simulator runs but has missing instruction decoding
- Known issues: Infinite loop in bubble sort, array not sorting
- Next: Complete simulator, fix control flow, implement ALU ops

FILES TO CONTINUE WORK ON:
1. deep16_simulator.lua - needs complete instruction decoding
2. as-deep16.lua - working assembler  
3. bubble_sort.asm - test program
4. Architecture spec defines all instructions

SPECIFIC TODOs:
- Decode instructions: 0x5A5A, 0x4105, 0x5B05, 0xB060
- Fix JMP relative addressing
- Implement MUL, DIV, SHIFT operations
- Fix the "shift encoding issue" noted earlier
- Get bubble sort actually working
